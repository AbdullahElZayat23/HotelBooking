According to time limitations,
Some modifications were planned to be included, but there's no time.

Like:

1-JWT.
2-Microsoft identity.
3-There are model state validations on both API and Client sides,
but it needs to be strengthened.
4-Improving UI appearance.
5-Refactoring the code.

AT the end, there are some bugs that for sure I'm aware of.
And I know the solution for it but as we know time limitations didn't help.

Hope you like it :).
